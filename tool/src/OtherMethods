Methods:	
	maf:
	calculate major allele frequency
	options:
		<-tf treat.bam> treat bam file
		<-cf control.bam> control bam file
		<-ef gencode.gtf> annotation gtf/gff file
		<-gf genome.fa> genome fasta file
		<-mutf snp.vcf> snp vcf/bed file
		<-o out_prefix> output file prefix
	
	seq:
	find base sequence around bed region in transcript (with only exons)
	options:
		<-peakf bed> bed file that need to find upstream and downstream.
		<-ef gencode.gtf> annotation gtf/gff file
		<-gf genome.fa> genome fasta file
		[-alen length] length of sequence needed. (default is 150, must bigger than 0)
	
	stat:
	result status in different bed files
	options:
		<-tf treat ...> treat bed file with 4th line is value
		<-cf control> control bed file with all regions need status
		<-o out_prefix> output file prefix
	
	cover:
	calculate relations between m6Apeaks and SNPs.
	options:
		<-tf treat.bam> treat bam file
		<-cf control.bam> control bam file
		<-ef gencode.gtf> annotation gtf/gff file
		<-peakf m6Apeak.bed> bed3 file that include m6Apeak regions.
		<-mutf snp.vcf> snp vcf/bed file
		<-o out_prefix> output file prefix
	
	split:
	split a bam into alt and ref use one snp site.
	options:
		<-tf treat.bam> treat bam file
		<-mutf snp.vcf> snp vcf/bed file
		<-o out_prefix> output file prefix
		[-minbr count] snp line number. (default is 0)
		[-sam] split in sam format. (default is bam)
