	sim:
	simulate fastq seq data with circRNAs, m6A peaks, structures and SNPs.

		[-peakf m6Apeak.bed] bed3 file that include m6Apeak regions.
		[-circf circRNA.bed] bed3 file that include circRNA regions.
		[-sf struct.bed] bed file with structure in 4th column.
		[-alen length] alignment length. (default is 150, must bigger than 0)
		[-rlen length] read fragment length. (default is 300, must bigger than alignment length) (Tips: single end simulation enabled when alignment length is the same as read fragment length)
		[-minalen length] minimum alignment length which sequence lower than this length would be dropped. (default is 30)
		[-faf frequency] enable and set fixed allele frequency. (default is disabled)
		[-peak] enable simulation with m6Apeaks.
		[-genef gene.bed] only the genes in this file can be used in simulation, and IP enrichment, IP read count, input read count can also be set in this file.
		[-lnp proportion] set linear reads proportion against circle reads. (default is 50)
		[-share] enable more than 1 circle m6Apeak in the same gene.
		[-nolinear] disable m6Apeak simulation when m6Apeaks do not overlap with circRNAs.
		[-npback proportion] set background proportion in non peak regions in IP against to input. (default is 0.01)
		[-minbr count] minimum background reads count in IP. (default is 0)
		[-enrich proportion] set m6Apeaks enrichment proportion. (default is calculated to ensure the same size between IP and input files.
		[-bases bases] allow structures show in some bases such as "AC". (default is all bases)
		[-mut] change structure simulation from RTstop to RTmutation.
