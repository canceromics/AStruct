Usage:

java [-Xmx16g] -jar AStruct.jar <method> [options]

Method:
	ribosnitch
	find different structure around SNPs. (all bams need to be sorted by coordinate)
	options:
		<-tf treat.bam ...> treat bam files
		<-cf control.bam ...> control bam files
		<-ef gencode.gtf> annotation gtf/gff file
		<-gf genome.fa> genome fasta file
		<-mutf snp.vcf> snp vcf/bed file
		<-o out_prefix> output file prefix
		[-permu count] set permutation with count times. (default is 1000)
		[-repli] enable replication filter
		[-seed seed] set random seed
		[-mut] switch between RTstop/RTmut
	
	sim:
	simulate fastq seq data with circRNAs, m6A peaks, structures and SNPs.
	options:
		<-ef gencode.gtf> annotation gtf/gff file
		<-gf genome.fa> genome fasta file
		<-o out_prefix> output file prefix
		[-mutf snp.vcf] snp vcf/bed file
		[-sf struct.bed] bed file with structure in 4th column.
		[-alen length] alignment length. (default is 150, must bigger than 0)
		[-rlen length] read fragment length. (default is 300, must bigger than alignment length) (Tips: single end simulation enabled when alignment length is the same as read fragment length)
		[-minalen length] minimum alignment length which sequence lower than this length would be dropped. (default is 30)
		[-faf frequency] enable and set fixed allele frequency. (default is disabled)
		[-genef gene.bed] only the genes in this file can be used in simulation, and IP enrichment, IP read count, input read count can also be set in this file.
		[-bases bases] allow structures show in some bases such as "AC". (default is all bases)
		[-mut] change structure simulation from RTstop to RTmutation.
